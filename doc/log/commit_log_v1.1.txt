Subject: Alarm handling bug fix.

- Applied an alarm handling bug fix that would not show the correct
alarm code, nor clear the alarm. It would occasionally go into an
infinite loop and would usually happen during a homing cycle fail.

Subject: Spindle PWM update for Mega2560

- Spindle PWM is set with a 16-bit value, rather than 8-bit on a 328p.
Updated stepper.c to reflect this change.

Subject: Grbl v1.1e port to Mega2560 branch

- v1.1e

- Ported all current changes from the main Grbl 328p repo to the
Mega2560 branch. Main differences are increased planner, RX, TX, and
line buffers. And an optional sleep timeout feature.

- WARNING: Code compiles, but has not been tested.
